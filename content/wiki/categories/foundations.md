## What's in this category

- **[<span id="strategic-pricing">Strategic pricing </span>](/wiki/pricing/foundations/strategic-pricing)**: A disciplined, value-based operating system for deciding **how you charge, what you charge, and how prices evolve** so profit, growth, and positioning stay aligned.
- **[<span id="value-based-pricing">Value-based pricing</span>](/wiki/pricing/foundations/value-based-pricing)**: Set prices from **the economic value you deliver and customers’ willingness to pay**, using costs and competitors mainly as floors/benchmarks—not the starting point.
- **[<span id="cost-plus-pricing">Cost-plus pricing</span>](/wiki/pricing/foundations/cost-plus-pricing)**: Price = cost + markup—useful for **price floors** and unit-economics sanity checks, but risky as a default because it can ignore customer value and WTP.
- **[<span id="customer-driven-pricing">Customer-driven pricing</span>](/wiki/pricing/foundations/customer-driven-pricing)**: Negotiate deal-by-deal to extract each buyer’s max WTP—often boosting short-term wins while **training haggling, punishing loyal customers, and eroding trust**.
- **[<span id="competition-based-pricing">Competition-based pricing</span>](/wiki/pricing/foundations/competition-based-pricing)**: Set prices by matching (or slightly offsetting) rivals—handy as a reference in commodity-like markets, but a weak default that **disconnects price from value** and can trigger price wars.
- **[<span id="skimming-strategy">Skimming strategy</span>](/wiki/pricing/foundations/skimming-strategy)**: Launch at a premium to monetize the highest-WTP tier first, then **step down in planned stages** to reach more price-sensitive segments without destroying the anchor.
- **[<span id="penetration-strategy">Penetration strategy</span>](/wiki/pricing/foundations/penetration-strategy)**: Launch below long-run profit-maximizing price to **accelerate adoption and share** (especially with scale/network effects), with explicit criteria and a path to normalize pricing later.
- **[<span id="maximization">Maximization</span>](/wiki/pricing/foundations/maximization)**: Choose the single price that **maximizes a chosen objective** (profit, revenue, or share) given demand and constraints—making pricing a testable, data-backed decision.
