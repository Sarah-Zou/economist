## What's in this category

- **[<span id="ideal-customer-profile">Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)</span>](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/ideal-customer-profile)**: Define the account/segment type that gets the most value from your offer and is most profitable and repeatable for you to acquire, retain, and expand.
- **[<span id="customer-use-cases">Customer Use Cases</span>](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/customer-use-cases)**: Describe the specific problem + context your product solves (for whom, why now, and compared to what alternative) so pricing and packaging map to real demand.
- **[<span id="jobs-to-be-done">Jobs‑to‑Be‑Done (JTBD)</span>](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/jobs-to-be-done)**: Frame demand as the "progress" customers want, so you can write clearer job statements and build messaging, onboarding, and packaging around outcomes.
- **[<span id="value-drivers">Value Drivers</span>](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/value-drivers)**: Identify and prioritize the specific economic/functional/risk/emotional benefits that create utility and drive willingness to pay.
- **[<span id="economic-value-estimation">Economic Value Estimation (EVE)</span>](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/economic-value-estimation)**: Quantify the dollar value you create versus the next‑best alternative (reference value + differentiation value) to set a value‑based ceiling and defend ROI.
- **[<span id="value-decoder-framework">Value Decoder framework</span>](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/value-decoder-framework)**: Turn perceived value into a defendable price band by anchoring on the next‑best alternative and adjusting for product differences and context (income, complements, environment).
- **[<span id="willingness-to-pay">Willingness to Pay (WTP)</span>](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/willingness-to-pay)**: Measure the maximum price buyers accept (as a distribution) to choose a defensible price range, design tiers, and validate against unit economics.
- **[<span id="customer-segments">Segmentation by WTP / Use Case</span>](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/customer-segments)**: Group customers by distinct jobs/use cases and WTP, then align packages, fences, and price points to capture more of the demand curve.
- **[<span id="price-fences-price-discrimination">Price fences / price discrimination</span>](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/price-fences-price-discrimination)**: Implement enforceable criteria that separate segments so you can charge different effective prices without leakage or a fairness backlash.

## How to use this

This category helps you understand your customers deeply so you can price based on value rather than cost or competition. Use these concepts to identify your highest-value customers, understand what drives their purchasing decisions, and design pricing that captures more of the value you create.
