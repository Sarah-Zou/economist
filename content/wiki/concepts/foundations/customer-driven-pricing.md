## Snapshot (TL;DR)

**What it is:** An approach where a firm actively determines how much a specific individual customer is willing to pay (WTP) for its product or service, often by gathering information about their circumstances (e.g., job, family, urgency) during a sales interaction, and then charging that maximum bearable price. This approach sometimes views low pricing as a substitute for inadequate marketing effort.

**Why it's tempting:** This method gives the company flexibility to charge different prices to different customers, theoretically allowing the firm to achieve a high volume of sales at the best possible margins. It recognizes the need for pricing to reflect market conditions, unlike cost-plus pricing.

**Where it fails:**
- **Trains Bad Behavior:** It trains good customers to become aggressive bargainers who demand concessions, thus undermining the integrity of future pricing.
- **Damages Relationships:** It inevitably alienates customers who pay more than the successful hagglers, damaging pride and hurting relationships. It channels creative energy into "winning" more or less money rather than building long-term, win-win partnerships.
- **Focuses on Transaction:** Buyers focus intensely on the transaction price rather than the seller's value propositions, often leading them to withhold information that could help the seller serve them better.
- **Leads to Price Cuts:** The resulting aggressive negotiation often forces the seller's commissioned salespeople to compromise and bring the price down promptly to close the deal, risking the loss of price integrity.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Relationship damage:** Customer-driven pricing alienates loyal customers who pay more than successful hagglers, damaging long-term relationships and trust.
- **Behavioral training:** This approach trains customers to become aggressive bargainers, undermining pricing integrity and creating a race to the bottom.

## What is customer-driven pricing?

**Customer-Driven Pricing (Consumer-Based Pricing)** is a pricing approach where the firm actively gathers detailed customer information to assess their price sensitivity and maximum WTP, adjusting the price up or down to match the size of the customer's wallet.

### Key definitions

**Display High Sticker Price → Gather Customer Data (WTP/Sensitivity) → Offer Discount Only If Necessary to Close Deal**

- **WTP assessment:** The process of gathering information about a customer's circumstances (job, family, urgency, financial situation) to estimate their maximum willingness to pay.
- **Price discrimination:** Charging different prices to different customers based on their assessed WTP rather than uniform value-based pricing.
- **Haggling:** The negotiation process where customers learn to demand concessions, and sellers adjust prices to close deals.

### Core assumptions (flawed)

Customer-driven pricing assumes:
- Flexibility in pricing is required to maximize sales volume and margin.
- Salespeople can accurately "size up" a customer's WTP and negotiation skill.
- The purpose of negotiation is to find the lowest price the customer will accept, rather than justify the value of the product.

## Why customer-driven pricing is tempting?

Customer-driven pricing offers apparent advantages that make it appealing, but these benefits come at significant long-term costs.

- **Flexibility to maximize margins:** Theoretically allows the firm to charge each customer their maximum WTP, potentially achieving higher margins than uniform pricing.
- **Reflects market conditions:** Recognizes that different customers have different WTP, unlike rigid cost-plus pricing that ignores market dynamics.
- **High volume potential:** Appears to enable high sales volume by adjusting prices to match individual customer price sensitivity.
- **Sales control:** Gives salespeople flexibility to close deals by adjusting prices based on perceived customer circumstances.

## Where customer-driven pricing fails

### Trains Bad Behavior

It trains good customers to become aggressive bargainers who demand concessions, thus undermining the integrity of future pricing. Once customers learn that prices are negotiable, they will consistently push for discounts, eroding margins over time.

### Damages Relationships

It inevitably alienates customers who pay more than the successful hagglers, damaging pride and hurting relationships. When customers discover they paid more than others for the same product, trust is broken. This approach channels creative energy into "winning" more or less money rather than building long-term, win-win partnerships.

### Focuses on Transaction

Buyers focus intensely on the transaction price rather than the seller's value propositions, often leading them to withhold information that could help the seller serve them better. The negotiation becomes adversarial rather than collaborative, preventing the seller from understanding true customer needs.

### Leads to Price Cuts

The resulting aggressive negotiation often forces the seller's commissioned salespeople to compromise and bring the price down promptly to close the deal, risking the loss of price integrity. Salespeople, incentivized by commissions, may prioritize closing deals over maintaining pricing discipline.

### Commoditization Risk

Over time, this strategy can lead to a decline in product differentiation and service quality across the industry, driving the product toward being a commodity (a service version of Gresham's law). When price becomes the primary focus, value and quality suffer.

## FAQ

**Q:** How is customer-driven pricing different from value-based pricing?

**A:** Customer-driven pricing focuses on extracting the maximum price from each individual customer through negotiation and haggling, often damaging relationships. Value-based pricing aligns price with the economic value delivered to customers, building trust and long-term partnerships.

**Q:** When might customer-driven pricing seem necessary?

**A:** In high-priced, complex deals (like car sales or B2B contracts), sellers may feel pressure to maximize each transaction. However, this short-term focus often comes at the cost of long-term customer relationships and pricing integrity.

**Q:** What's wrong with charging different prices to different customers?

**A:** Price discrimination can be legitimate when based on value differences, segments, or product variations. However, customer-driven pricing uses negotiation and haggling to extract maximum prices, which trains bad behavior and damages relationships. Transparent, value-based segmentation is preferable.

**Q:** How does customer-driven pricing affect sales teams?

**A:** It creates pressure on commissioned salespeople to negotiate prices down to close deals, undermining pricing discipline. Sales teams spend energy on price negotiation rather than value communication and relationship building.

**Q:** Can customer-driven pricing work in any context?

**A:** While it may appear to work in the short term, customer-driven pricing typically damages long-term customer relationships, trains aggressive bargaining behavior, and risks commoditizing the product. Value-based pricing with transparent segmentation is a more sustainable approach.
