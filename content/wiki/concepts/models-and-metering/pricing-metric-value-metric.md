## Snapshot (TL;DR)

**What it is:** The **pricing metric** is what you charge for (per seat, per API call, per GB). The **value metric** is what drives customer value (e.g. outcomes, usage, capability). Ideally they align so customers feel they pay for what they use or get.

**Why it matters:** Misalignment causes friction (“why am I paying per seat when value is per project?”). Alignment improves conversion, expansion, and perceived fairness.

**When to use:** When defining or refining your [monetization model](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/monetization-model); when moving to [usage-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/usage-based-pricing) or [tiered](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/tiered-graduated-block-pricing) pricing.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Choose one primary pricing metric when possible; multiple metrics add complexity and can confuse buyers.
- Value metrics help you position and package; pricing metrics define the contract and billing system.
- Common pricing metrics: seats, MAU, API calls, storage, transactions, outcomes.
