## Snapshot (TL;DR)

**What it is:** Customer commits to a minimum fee or minimum usage (e.g. $X/month or Y units). Usage above the commitment is billed at an overage rate. Sometimes called “commit-to-consume.”

**Why it matters:** Gives you predictable baseline revenue while still aligning with [usage-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/usage-based-pricing) value; reduces pure PAYG volatility and supports sales-led deals with committed minimums.

**When to use:** When you want both commitment (for forecasting and sales) and fairness (customers pay for what they use above the floor); common in [hybrid](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/hybrid-pricing) and enterprise [usage-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/usage-based-pricing) deals.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Set the minimum at a level that’s achievable for the segment; unattainable minimums create churn and conflict.
- Overage rate and caps (e.g. 2x commitment) should be clear; consider [tiered](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/tiered-graduated-block-pricing) overage to encourage growth.
- Often used with [prepaid credits](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/prepaid-credits-drawdown-model) or drawdown so commitment is consumed first, then overage.
