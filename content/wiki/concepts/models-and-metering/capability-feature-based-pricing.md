## Snapshot (TL;DR)

**What it is:** Access and price are determined by which capabilities or features are included—e.g. basic vs. pro vs. enterprise feature sets, or add-on modules (AI, compliance, integrations). Often implemented as [tiered](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/tiered-graduated-block-pricing) or [seat-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/seat-based-pricing) plans with different feature access.

**Why it matters:** Lets you capture more from customers who need advanced features while keeping entry-level pricing accessible; supports segmentation by use case and willingness to pay.

**When to use:** When you have a clear feature/capability ladder and distinct segments that value different bundles.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Align capabilities with [value metric](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/pricing-metric-value-metric) and outcomes so higher tiers feel justified, not arbitrary.
- Avoid “feature soup”—keep tiers distinct and easy to compare; use [good-better-best](/wiki/pricing/packaging-and-bundling/good-better-best) style packaging where possible.
- Can be combined with [usage-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/usage-based-pricing) or [subscription](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/subscription-model) so that both “what you get” and “how much you use” can drive price.
