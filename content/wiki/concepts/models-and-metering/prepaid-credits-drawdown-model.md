## Snapshot (TL;DR)

**What it is:** Customer buys a block of credits (e.g. API calls, compute minutes, storage) upfront; usage “draws down” the balance. When credits run low or out, they top up or move to [overage](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/minimum-commitment-plus-overage) billing.

**Why it matters:** Improves cash flow and commitment while keeping [usage-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/usage-based-pricing) fairness; common in developer tools, AI/ML, and infrastructure.

**When to use:** When buyers are comfortable prepaying for expected usage and you can meter consumption clearly; often paired with [minimum commitment + overage](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/minimum-commitment-plus-overage) for enterprise.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Define credit unit clearly (e.g. 1 credit = 1 API call or 1 minute) and expiration/rollover rules to avoid confusion.
- Balance prepay discount with flexibility; too aggressive expiration can create waste and dissatisfaction.
- Drawdown can sit alongside [subscription](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/subscription-model) (e.g. base fee + credit pool) in a [hybrid](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/hybrid-pricing) model.
