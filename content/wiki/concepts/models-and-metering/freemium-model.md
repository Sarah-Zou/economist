## Snapshot (TL;DR)

**What it is:** A [monetization model](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/monetization-model) that offers a free tier (freemium) with constraints (usage caps, feature limits, or support level) and monetizes through upgrades to paid [subscription](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/subscription-model) [tiers](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/tiered-graduated-block-pricing) or [usage-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/usage-based-pricing) overage.

**Why it matters:** Lowers adoption friction and supports product-led growth; free users can become paying customers when they hit limits or need more [capability](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/capability-feature-based-pricing).

**When to use:** When marginal cost of free users is low, conversion path is clear, and you can sustain support and infrastructure for free usage.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Design the free tier to demonstrate value and create a natural upgrade trigger (usage, features, or support), not to give away the whole product.
- Monitor free-to-paid conversion and cost per free user; tune limits and [tiered](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/tiered-graduated-block-pricing) offers accordingly.
- Freemium often pairs with [seat-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/seat-based-pricing) or [capability-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/capability-feature-based-pricing) paid tiers.
