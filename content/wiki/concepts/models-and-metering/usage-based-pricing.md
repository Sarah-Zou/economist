## Snapshot (TL;DR)

**What it is:** Customers pay based on measured usage (API calls, GB processed, minutes, events, etc.) rather than a fixed subscription. Often called pay-as-you-go (PAYG).

**Why it matters:** Aligns cost with value for variable workloads; lowers barrier to entry; can drive strong expansion when usage grows with customer success.

**When to use:** When usage is variable and correlates with value; when you can meter reliably and customers accept variable bills.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Requires robust [pricing metric](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/pricing-metric-value-metric) and metering; clarity on what counts and how it’s billed is critical.
- Can be combined with a [minimum commitment + overage](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/minimum-commitment-plus-overage) or [prepaid credits](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/prepaid-credits-drawdown-model) to reduce revenue volatility.
- [Hybrid](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/hybrid-pricing) (base subscription + usage) is common in enterprise to balance predictability and fairness.
