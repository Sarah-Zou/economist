## Snapshot (TL;DR)

**What it is:** Fees are linked to measurable outcomes or performance—e.g. % of revenue generated, cost saved, leads closed, or other agreed KPIs—instead of seats, usage, or flat fees.

**Why it matters:** Aligns vendor and customer incentives and can justify premium pricing when outcomes are clear and measurable.

**When to use:** When value is directly tied to a measurable business result and both parties can agree on definition and measurement.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Requires clear definition of the outcome, attribution, and data access; legal and governance complexity is higher than with [subscription](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/subscription-model) or [usage-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/usage-based-pricing) alone.
- Often used in sales tech, marketing tech, and professional services; can be combined with a base fee plus outcome-based upside.
- Best when the outcome is indisputable and easy to measure; avoid when attribution is murky or disputed.
