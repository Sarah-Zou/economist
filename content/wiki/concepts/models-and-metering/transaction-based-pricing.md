## Snapshot (TL;DR)

**What it is:** Customers pay per transaction—e.g. per payment processed, per order, per API call, or per document. The [pricing metric](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/pricing-metric-value-metric) is the transaction itself (often with volume tiers or caps).

**Why it matters:** Aligns cost with volume and value for marketplaces, payments, and API-driven products; revenue scales with customer success.

**When to use:** When value is clearly tied to transaction volume and you can count and bill transactions reliably.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Define the transaction clearly (what counts, what doesn’t) and whether pricing is per unit, [tiered](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/tiered-graduated-block-pricing), or [commit-plus-overage](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/minimum-commitment-plus-overage).
- Can be combined with a base [subscription](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/subscription-model) in a [hybrid](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/hybrid-pricing) model.
- Common in fintech, e-commerce, and developer tools; watch for high-volume, low-margin scenarios and consider minimums or blocks.
