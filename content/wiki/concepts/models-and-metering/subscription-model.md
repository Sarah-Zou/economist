## Snapshot (TL;DR)

**What it is:** Customers pay a fixed fee at regular intervals (monthly, annual, or multi-year) for ongoing access to the product or service. No usage-based variable component unless combined with [hybrid pricing](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/hybrid-pricing).

**Why it matters:** Subscriptions create predictable revenue, simplify budgeting for buyers, and support retention and expansion when value is continuous.

**When to use:** When value is ongoing (access to software, support, content) and usage is relatively stable or capped by [tiers](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/tiered-graduated-block-pricing) or [seats](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/seat-based-pricing).

**Key Takeaways:**

- Monthly vs. annual billing trades off cash flow and commitment; annual often carries a discount to improve retention and reduce churn.
- Subscription can be combined with [usage-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/usage-based-pricing) or [overage](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/minimum-commitment-plus-overage) for [hybrid](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/hybrid-pricing) models.
- Clear renewal terms, price caps, and upgrade paths reduce friction and support expansion.
