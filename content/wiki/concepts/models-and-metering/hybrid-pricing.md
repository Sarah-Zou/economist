## Snapshot (TL;DR)

**What it is:** A [monetization model](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/monetization-model) that mixes fixed and variable elements—e.g. base [subscription](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/subscription-model) + [usage-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/usage-based-pricing) overage, or [seat-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/seat-based-pricing) fee + per-transaction or per-API-call pricing.

**Why it matters:** Balances predictability (fixed base) with alignment to value (variable component); common in enterprise where buyers want a floor and vendors want to capture growth.

**When to use:** When value has both an “access” component (seats, platform) and a “consumption” component (usage, transactions); when moving from pure [subscription](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/subscription-model) to more [usage-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/usage-based-pricing) without going full PAYG.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Design the base to cover “minimum viable value” and the variable component to scale with [pricing metric](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/pricing-metric-value-metric) (usage, seats, transactions).
- Communicate clearly: “$X/month base + $Y per unit above Z” so buyers can model cost; consider [minimum commitment + overage](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/minimum-commitment-plus-overage) framing.
- Billing and metering must support both components; [tiered](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/tiered-graduated-block-pricing) or [prepaid credits](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/prepaid-credits-drawdown-model) can simplify the variable piece.
