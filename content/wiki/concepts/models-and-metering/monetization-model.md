## Snapshot (TL;DR)

**What it is:** The high-level structure that defines how you charge for your product or service—e.g. subscription, usage-based, transaction-based, or hybrid.

**Why it matters:** Choosing the right monetization model aligns revenue with how customers derive value and supports predictable growth and unit economics.

**When to use:** Early in product and GTM design; when evolving from one model to another (e.g. flat fee to usage-based).

**Key Takeaways:**

- Your monetization model should mirror how customers get value (per seat, per API call, per outcome, etc.).
- Common models include [subscription](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/subscription-model), [usage-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/usage-based-pricing), [seat-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/seat-based-pricing), [transaction-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/transaction-based-pricing), and [hybrid](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/hybrid-pricing) approaches.
- Changing the model is a strategic decision; it affects sales motion, billing systems, and customer expectations.
