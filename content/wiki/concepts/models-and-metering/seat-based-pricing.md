## Snapshot (TL;DR)

**What it is:** Customers pay per user or per seat—each person with access is a billable unit. Often tiered (e.g. first 5 seats at $X, next 10 at $Y) or with volume discounts.

**Why it matters:** Simple to understand and sell; scales with team size and aligns with “who uses the product.” Common in collaboration, productivity, and B2B SaaS.

**When to use:** When value is driven by how many people use the product and usage per user is relatively consistent.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Seat count is a clear [pricing metric](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/pricing-metric-value-metric); ensure it aligns with value (e.g. active users vs. provisioned seats) to avoid gaming or conflict.
- Often combined with [tiered](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/tiered-graduated-block-pricing) or [capability-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/capability-feature-based-pricing) pricing (more features at higher tiers) and sometimes with [usage-based](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/usage-based-pricing) in a [hybrid](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/hybrid-pricing) model.
- Consider minimum seats, seat minimums per tier, and expansion mechanics (e.g. adding seats at renewal).
