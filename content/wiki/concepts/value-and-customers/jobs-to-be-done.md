## Snapshot (TL;DR)

**What it is:** JTBD describes **why customers buy or churn** by identifying the job they "hire" a product to do in a specific situation.

**Why it matters:**
- **Predictable demand:** Jobs already exist; you're aligning to a current of demand rather than inventing one.
- **Faster sales + fewer discounts:** Job-aligned packaging makes value obvious and reduces explanation.
- **Cleaner product lines:** Avoid **monoliths** (overbuilt bundles) and **hydras** (unmanageable module sprawl) by bundling around jobs.

**When to use:**
- **Early:** shaping a value proposition, positioning, or category story
- **Growth stalls:** diagnosing churn, low conversion, or heavy discounting
- **Pricing & [packaging](/wiki/pricing/packaging-and-bundling):** designing plans, picking a [value metric](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/value-metric), or adding tiers/[fences](/wiki/pricing/price-architecture) by stakes/context
- **Product direction:** deciding what to build next based on real switching triggers

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Context is Queen:** The "when" and "where" matter more than the "who"; People with different titles can share the same job.
- **Competition is broader than your category:** You're competing with spreadsheets, agencies, internal hacks, and "do nothing," not just direct rivals.
- **Switching is emotional + rational:** The *Push/Pull/Habit/Anxiety* forces explain why customers stall—even when value is obvious.
- **Packaging and pricing follow the job:** Align tiers, [fences](/wiki/pricing/price-architecture), and the [value metric](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/value-metric) to the customer's unit of progress; then validate [willingness-to-pay](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/willingness-to-pay).

## Key Facts

- **75% failed:** Research indicates that **75% of venture-funded startups fail**, often because they lack a well-aligned price for their chosen buyer or solve a "problem" that isn't a "job". [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done).
- **86% success rate:** In a reported study of ODI/JTBD projects, **18 of 21** launches were rated successful (**86%** success rate). [Why do innovation projects fail?](https://anthonyulwick.com/2016/10/26/why-do-innovation-projects-fail/).
- **Less Pricing Sensitive:** In B2B software, **[value drivers](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/value-drivers) and specific jobs are more important** than price which is typically only the third to seventh most important factor in a purchase decision.

## What is Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)?

The **Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)** theory, pioneered by Clayton Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor, asserts that customers do not buy products; they "hire" them to perform a specific "job". 

A "job" is distinct from a mere "problem." While a problem is a situation a user doesn't want to be in, **a job requires intentionality**—a clear desire to move from a current state "A" to a desired state "B". To have effective demand, the customer must be actively searching for a solution or have an intention to get the task done.

### Key definitions

* **Job executor:** The person who experiences the struggle and decides to "hire" a solution (may differ from payer/admin in B2B).
* **Job statement (functional core):** *Help [actor] [make progress] in/when [circumstance] despite [constraints].*
* **Job story (format):** *When ___, I want to ___, so I can ___.*
* **Desired outcomes (ODI lens):** Metrics the customer uses to judge success (speed, effort, reliability, risk, compliance).

## Why do Jobs to Be Done matter?

For startup founders, JTBD is the bridge between understanding customer demand and designing products, pricing, and messaging that align with real switching triggers.

- **Predictable Demand:** A package built around a job taps into a pre-existing stream of demand. As one entrepreneur noted, it is like "holding your cup out—the water was already running".

- **Efficiency in Sales:** Aligning packaging with specific jobs makes the product instantly understandable to the buyer, which reduces sales cycles and minimizes the need for heavy discounting.

- **Portfolio Integrity:** Using JTBD prevents the creation of **"Monoliths"** (overengineered products that deliver too much functionality for most users, leading to under-monetization) and **"Hydras"** (products that grow in unmanageable complexity because every new feature is spun out as a new module).

## Mental model 

### The Forces of Progress

To understand why a customer "hires" your startup, you must look at the four forces acting on them at the moment of purchase:

![Jobs to Be Done Mental Model: A visual diagram showing the four forces of progress that influence customer decision-making at the moment of purchase. The Forces of Progress framework includes: Push of the Current Situation (the pain and frustration with the status quo that drives customers to seek change), Pull of the New Solution (the appeal and promise of your product that attracts customers), Anxiety of the New (fear and uncertainty about switching to a new solution), and Allegiance to the Old (habit, inertia, and comfort with existing solutions that keep customers from switching). This framework helps explain why customers switch or stay with existing solutions, and guides product, messaging, and onboarding strategies to overcome switching barriers.](/images/wiki_JTBD_mental.png)

1. **Push of the Current Situation:** The pain of the status quo (e.g., "This spreadsheet is breaking").
2. **Pull of the New Solution:** The appeal of your product's promise (e.g., "This dashboard looks effortless").
3. **Anxiety of the New:** Fear of the unknown (e.g., "Will this be hard to learn?").
4. **Allegiance to the Old:** Habit and inertia (e.g., "I already know how to use my messy spreadsheet").

## Rules of thumb

### Interview count

Approximately **90% of key customer needs** can be identified by conducting just **10–12 in-depth interviews** per market segment. (source: The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing)

### The Drill/Hole Maxim

"People don't want a quarter-inch drill; they want a quarter-inch hole."

### The "Workaround" Rule

If you see people using a tool for something it wasn't intended for (e.g., using Excel as a CRM), there is a massive JTBD opportunity there.

## How to Apply It

### Inputs you need

* **10–15 recent "hired" or "fired" customers** (bought or churned in the last ~90 days)
* **A place to observe real work** (screenshare, ride-along, session replays) to see where they struggle
* **Context notes:** team setup, stakes (deadlines/risk), constraints (security/compliance), who approves (B2B)
* **Light product data:** time-to-first-value, retention, key activation events

### Step-by-step

1. **Identify the Struggle:** Ask: *"What happened that made you realize you needed a change?"* Note the context, stakes, and current workaround.

2. **Write the Job Statement:** Use the formula: **[Action] + [Object] + [Context]**

   * Example: "Organize (Action) my team's tasks (Object) when we are all working remotely (Context)."

3. **Map the Forces:** Identify what is pushing them toward you and what is keeping them stuck.

   * **Push:** what's broken now?
   * **Pull:** what's attractive about the new?
   * **Habit:** what keeps the old?
   * **Anxiety:** what scares them about switching?

4. **Design for the Job:** Align your features, marketing copy, and onboarding specifically to address that "Progress."

   * **Product:** prioritize what removes struggle and improves outcomes.
   * **Messaging:** lead with context + progress (not features).
   * **Onboarding:** get them to the first *job-complete* moment fast.
   * **Packaging/pricing:** pick a [value metric](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/value-metric) that matches the job; add [fences](/wiki/pricing/price-architecture) for higher-stakes contexts.

## Metrics to monitor

- **Time-to-value (TTV):** How quickly does the user realize the "progress" they were looking for? (time from signup to first job-complete moment)
- **Job completion rate / Success Rate:** How often can the user complete the "job" using your tool?
- **Retention by job segment:** Cohort retention by primary job

## Risks & anti-patterns (and how to fix them)

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Treating jobs like personas:** [Segmenting](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers#customer-segments) by titles or company size instead of context and stakes. | Segment by context + stakes + constraints (and job frequency). Titles/company size are secondary. |
| **Writing solution-y job statements:** Using product words in job statements (e.g., "Use dashboards to…"). | Rewrite to [Action] + [Object] + [Context] with no product words; validate against workarounds and "do nothing." |
| **Skipping the forces:** Hearing "looks great" but deals stall without understanding why. | Always map Push / Pull / Habit / Anxiety and design proof to reduce anxiety (templates, ROI calc, security docs, references). |
| **Interviewing only happy customers or power users:** Missing insights from customers who didn't succeed. | Include recent churn, lost deals, and recent switchers; switching reveals real criteria and fears. |
| **[Packaging](/wiki/pricing/packaging-and-bundling) by feature buckets, not jobs:** Organizing plans by features like "Analytics," "Automation," "Integrations." | Bundle around jobs and stakes; put "must-have to complete the job" features in the tier where that job lives. |
| **Calling every loss "too expensive":** Assuming price is always the issue when deals are lost. | Diagnose the quality of the no: was it the wrong job fit, unclear proof, wrong [value metric](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/value-metric), or missing [fence](/wiki/pricing/price-architecture) (e.g., SSO/SLA/audit logs)? |

## FAQ

**Q:** How do I know if I have a "job" or just a "problem"?

**A:** A job has intentionality. If you look at your market and people are already spending money or significant time trying to solve it, it's a job.

**Q:** Is JTBD just another name for personas?

**A:** No. Personas describe *who*; JTBD explains *why now* (context + progress + tradeoffs).

**Q:** Can JTBD work in B2B with multiple stakeholders?

**A:** Yes—model executor, buyer, approver separately and map their anxieties (security, risk, budget).

**Q:** How does JTBD connect to pricing?

**A:** Jobs reveal the customer's unit of progress → informs [value metric](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering/value-metric), [packaging](/wiki/pricing/packaging-and-bundling), and [fences](/wiki/pricing/price-architecture); then quantify with [WTP research](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/willingness-to-pay).

**Q:** Should I put my newest, most advanced features in my highest tier?

**A:** Not necessarily. If a feature is essential to solving the specific job of a lower tier, put it there to ensure the customer gets value. Differentiate your tiers by the *jobs* they solve, not just by feature count.

**Q:** What's a quick sign we picked the wrong job?

**A:** Your "competition" list looks narrow (only direct rivals) and your messaging is feature-heavy rather than outcome/constraint-driven.
