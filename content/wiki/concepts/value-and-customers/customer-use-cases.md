## Snapshot (TL;DR)

**What it is:** Customer use cases are structured descriptions of a specific problem, target persona, context, and success metrics that define *how* and *why* a customer "hires" your product.

**Why it matters:**
- Turns pricing into a "price-your-customer" decision grounded in jobs and outcomes, not internal feature lists.
- Reduces product failure and "feature shock" by focusing on a few high-value jobs instead of many low-value features.
- Aligns product, sales, and marketing around a shared, testable view of where value actually comes from.

**When to use:**
- Defining or redesigning [plan structure](/wiki/pricing/packaging-and-bundling#good-better-best) (good–better–best, [add-ons](/wiki/pricing/packaging-and-bundling#unbundling-addons), or enterprise tiers).
- Evaluating new [segments](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers#customer-segments) or verticals and deciding whether they justify a distinct plan or price point.
- Choosing or revisiting your core [pricing metric](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering#pricing-metric) (seats, usage, outcomes, revenue processed, etc.).
- Prioritizing roadmap and GTM investments by impact on your top 3–7 revenue-driving use cases.
- Cleaning up a cluttered catalog of legacy plans that no longer map to real customer jobs.

**Key Takeaways:**

- A use case is a combination of **problem + persona + context + outcome**, not a feature list, persona label, or industry.
- Most SaaS companies should optimize pricing and roadmap around **3–7 primary use cases** (1–2 at seed stage) that drive the majority of revenue.
- Each plan should map clearly to **one anchor use case** (or at most two), expressed in plain, outcome-oriented language.
- Frequency and intensity of the problem are core inputs to your [pricing metric](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering#pricing-metric) and [willingness-to-pay](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/willingness-to-pay).

## Key Facts

- **98% of new users:** **98% of new users** will churn within the first 14 days if they do not experience the product's core value (the "Aha! moment") through a specific use case. [Amplitude 2025 Product Benchmark Report](https://amplitude.com/blog/time-to-value-drives-user-retention)
- **30% Conversion Lift:** Clear use-case-based marketing can increase landing page conversions by up to **30%** compared to feature-heavy messaging. [Adobe Summit](https://business.adobe.com/summit/2025/sessions/data-collaboration-with-adobe-how-alterra-achieved-s507.html)
- **25% faster:** Sales cycles are often **25% faster** when reps lead with a specific use case rather than a general product demo. [Articsledge](https://www.articsledge.com/post/ai-micro-segmentation)

## What is Customer Use Cases?

A **Customer Use Case** is a foundational monetization strategy that defines a specific problem a product solves, the target persona facing that problem, and the context in which they seek a solution. It moves beyond technical features to focus on the **[Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/jobs-to-be-done)**—the specific outcome a customer is trying to achieve. 

In B2B SaaS, this is the first "price-your-customer" decision, categorizing users by how they derive value from your capability. 

- **Example:** "RevOps manager at a 50–200 person SaaS company uses our platform weekly to identify at-risk deals and reduce pipeline slippage by 15%."
- **Job-to-be-done (JTBD):** The underlying problem or "job" the customer hires your product to do (e.g., "get a clean, deduped customer list"), independent of your feature names. See [Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/jobs-to-be-done) for more details.
- **Use case vs. segment:** *[Segment](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers#customer-segments)* = group of customers with similar characteristics (company size, industry, budget, etc.). *Use case* = what those customers actually do with the product to create value. A segment can contain multiple use cases; a use case can appear across multiple segments.
- **Primary vs. secondary use case:** *Primary use case* = the main job that justifies the purchase and drives [willingness to pay](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/willingness-to-pay). *Secondary use cases* = additional jobs that are nice-to-have but usually not the core reason to buy.

## Why do Customer Use Cases matter?

For startup founders, customer use cases are the bridge between product features and pricing strategy. Approximately **72%** of new products fail because they are the "wrong answer to the right question" or an answer to a question no one was asking. Mapping use cases prevents "Feature Shock," where a company overengineers a product with "nice-to-haves" that increase costs without increasing [willingness-to-pay (WTP)](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/willingness-to-pay).

- **Avoids "Undead" Products:** Focuses development on jobs customers actually need done, not features that look good on paper.
- **Efficiency:** Prevents overengineering by identifying which features are must-haves vs. nice-to-haves for each use case.
- **Scalability:** Aligning your product with specific use cases leads to shorter sales cycles, less discounting, and higher Net Retention Rates (NRR).

## Mental model 

Think of customer use cases as a structured card:

![Customer Use Cases Mental Model: A visual diagram showing how customer use cases are structured as cards. The Use Case Card framework includes: Who (role, company type, size), When (trigger event / frequency), Goal / outcome (what success looks like), Constraints (time, budget, compliance, skill, integrations), Success metrics (e.g., time saved, error rate, revenue uplift), Critical features (must-haves to achieve the outcome), and Nice-to-haves (extras that delight but are not decisive). This card-based framework helps pricing teams make strategic decisions about which use cases to optimize for, serve but not optimize, or say no to.](/images/wiki_usecase_mental.png)

Pricing uses these cards to make choices about:

- Which use cases to **optimize for** (anchor plans, headline messaging).
- Which to **serve but not optimize** (add-ons, upsells, manual workarounds).
- Which to **say no to** (edge cases that distract your roadmap).

## Rules of thumb

### Revenue coverage rule

Aim for **3–7 primary use cases** that together account for **≥70–85%** of current and target revenue.

### Dedicated plan threshold

If a distinct use case represents **≥20–30% of revenue** *and* has materially different [WTP](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/willingness-to-pay) or feature needs, consider a dedicated [plan or bundle](/wiki/pricing/packaging-and-bundling#bundling).

### Use case profitability (simplified)

[Use case profit] ≈ (Average [WTP](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/willingness-to-pay) per customer × # of addressable customers) − (Incremental cost-to-serve). Focus on use cases where this is clearly positive and defensible.

### Plan clarity rule

If sales reps or customers cannot articulate in one sentence which plan is for which use case, your [packaging](/wiki/pricing/packaging-and-bundling#packaging) is too abstract.

## How to Apply It

### Inputs you need

* **Basic persona data:** Role, company type/size, team, budget authority.
* **10–20 recent customer conversations:** Wins, losses, churn with raw notes.
* **Call notes, support tickets, and onboarding feedback:** With **verbatim** problem statements.
* **High-level product usage data:** To approximate **frequency** and **intensity** of the problem.
* **Competitive Analysis:** Identifying "gaps" where competitors fail to address specific workflows.

### Methods (research & analysis)

* **JTBD interviews:** Focused on problem, persona, context, alternatives, and frequency.
* **Light coding / clustering:** Of interview notes into problem, persona, alternative, and value drivers.
* **Tag accounts by primary use case:** In CRM or a spreadsheet and sum revenue / logo counts.
* **Pricing / [WTP tests](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/willingness-to-pay):** Surveys or conversations framed around concrete use case descriptions.
* **Quick experiments:** On plan names, messaging, or bundles tied to top use cases.

### Step-by-step

Use this flow to define a customer use case in a way that directly feeds your monetization model.

1. **Identify the problem your product solves (in customers' words):**

   Review interviews, support tickets, and sales calls to pull *verbatim* problem statements. Write a simple problem sentence: "When *[trigger]*, I struggle to *[job]*, which leads to *[negative outcome]*." Sanity check: a non-expert in your product should still understand the problem.

2. **Define the target persona who has this problem:** Specify **role, seniority, company type/size, and team context** (e.g., "RevOps manager at 50–200 person SaaS company"). Capture why *this* persona owns the problem (KPIs, responsibilities, incentives). Note any constraints that affect [willingness-to-pay](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/willingness-to-pay) (budget authority, procurement, risk tolerance).

3. **Identify alternative solutions (including non-consumption):** List realistic alternatives: competing tools, spreadsheets, manual processes, internal builds, "do nothing". For each alternative, capture: cost (time/money), reliability, and key limitations. Use this to highlight adjacent customer problems that could become future monetization opportunities (e.g., services, add-ons, higher tiers).

4. **Understand why users choose your product over alternatives:** Ask directly: "Why did you choose us instead of X?" and "What almost stopped you from choosing us?" Distill 2–3 **[value drivers](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers#value-drivers)** (e.g., speed, accuracy, compliance, collaboration) that matter most for this use case. Translate these value drivers into pricing levers: higher tiers for premium outcomes, [add-ons](/wiki/pricing/packaging-and-bundling#unbundling-addons) for specialized capabilities, [usage metric](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering#usage-based-pricing) aligned to the value driver.

5. **Determine the frequency and intensity of the problem:** Estimate how often the persona encounters the problem (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, quarterly). Assess intensity: what happens if they *don't* solve it (lost revenue, fines, churn, reputational risk)? Use frequency × intensity to choose [pricing metrics](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering#pricing-metric) and tiers: High frequency + high intensity → strong case for higher ACV and/or [usage-based pricing](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering#usage-based-pricing). Low frequency + moderate intensity → better fit for project-based, feature-gated, or [add-on pricing](/wiki/pricing/packaging-and-bundling#unbundling-addons).

6. **Draft the use case card and link it to pricing/packaging:** Fill out a standard use case card: Who, When, Goal/outcome, Constraints, Success metrics, Critical features, Nice-to-haves. Decide how this use case maps to your monetization model: Which **[plan or bundle](/wiki/pricing/packaging-and-bundling#bundling)** is the natural home for this use case? Which **[pricing metric](/wiki/pricing/models-and-metering#pricing-metric)** reflects how value scales (seats, usage, revenue processed, etc.)? Which **features must be included** vs. sold as [add-ons](/wiki/pricing/packaging-and-bundling#unbundling-addons)?

7. **Quantify and prioritize across use cases:** Tag existing customers with their primary use case using the above definition. For each use case, estimate: revenue today, growth potential, discounting levels, and support cost. Prioritize 3–7 primary use cases to optimize for in your pricing; treat others as secondary or out-of-scope.

## Metrics to monitor

- **Plan / use case mix:** Share of revenue and customers by primary use case and plan.
- **ARPU / ACV by use case:** Are high-value use cases paying meaningfully more?
- **Win rate by use case:** Where does your value proposition resonate most?
- **Discount rate by use case:** Are some use cases only closing with heavy discounting (sign of poor fit or wrong metric)?
- **Expansion and NRR by use case:** Which use cases drive expansions, seats, or usage growth over time?
- **Feature adoption by use case:** Are must-have features actually used by the intended use case cluster?

## Risks & anti-patterns (and how to fix them)

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Selling "Tools," Not "Jobs":** Offering a list of features (e.g., "Analytics") rather than a solution (e.g., "Predictive Maintenance"). | Repackage features around the outcome they enable. |
| **Confusing use cases with personas or verticals:** Defining segments like "marketing" or "healthcare" without understanding what those customers actually do. | Force each use case to include a specific job, trigger, and success metric. |
| **Overfitting to edge cases:** Building plans or features for noisy but low-revenue use cases. | Quantify revenue and growth by use case before committing; set a minimum revenue threshold for new plans. |
| **Too many use cases:** A long list (10–20+) that no one can remember or act on. | Group related use cases; keep an executive version (3–7 primary) and move the rest to sub-variants. |

## FAQ

**Q:** How many customer use cases do we actually need?

**A:** Most startups and scale-ups should aim for **3–7 primary use cases** that cover the majority of revenue, plus a handful of secondary variants documented for context. For a seed-stage startup, ideally 1–2; focus is your greatest competitive advantage against incumbents.

**Q:** Are use cases the same as personas or segments?

**A:** No. Personas describe *who* your customers are; segments define groups for targeting. Use cases describe *what they do* with your product and *why* it matters. You need all three, but use cases are the best bridge to pricing.

**Q:** What if a customer fits multiple use cases?

**A:** Pick a **primary use case** that best explains their reason to buy and [WTP](/wiki/pricing/value-and-customers/willingness-to-pay), price for that, and treat other jobs as bonus value or upsell opportunities.

**Q:** Does this approach work for PLG / self-serve products?

**A:** Yes. Even in PLG, you should design plan names, feature gates, and upgrade prompts around clear use cases (e.g., "team collaboration" vs. "advanced automation"), not arbitrary feature counts.

**Q:** How often should we refresh our use case map?

**A:** At least **annually**, or whenever you launch major new capabilities, enter a new market, or see big shifts in who is buying and why.

**Q:** Can we start small?

**A:** Yes. Start by tagging new opportunities in your CRM with an informal use case label. After 2–3 months, review patterns, refine definitions, and then invest in a full use-case-driven pricing redesign if warranted.

**Q:** Is a "User Story" the same as a "Use Case"?

**A:** No. A user story is for *developers* to build a feature; a use case is for *the business* to define how value is delivered to the customer.

**Q:** When should we create a new use case?

**A:** Only when you have evidence of a repeatable segment of users using your product for a purpose you didn't originally intend.
