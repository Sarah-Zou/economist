- Good: `_posts/2025-07-01-fractional-economist-value.md` 
- Bad: `_posts/2024-06-15-post.md` (NEVER use 2024 unless actually uploading in 2024)
- Bad: `pricing_strategies.md` (no underscores)
- Bad: `2025-6-15-post.md` (missing zero padding)
- Bad: `SaaS-Pricing.md` (no capitals in filename)

**Date Generation Rule:**
- **Use the actual date when you are uploading the article**
- **If uploading on June 15, 2025, filename starts with:** `2025-06-15-`

```

### 4. Meta Description Rules
**Character count:** 150-160 characters exactly
**Structure:** Hook + Value Proposition + CTA
```yaml

# Incorrect URLs:
