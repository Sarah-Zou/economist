# Storytelling With Metrics

**For SaaS founders, metrics are not just numbers—they're the language investors speak**. The way you present and contextualize your metrics directly shapes how investors perceive your traction, team, and potential.

**As your company grows, so should your storytelling.** Founders must evolve their investor narrative—shifting the metrics they emphasize and the angles they frame them through—at each stage of fundraising, from pre-seed to pre-IPO.

## Crafting Your Metrics Story by Growth Stage

### **1. Pre-Seed Stage: Validating Demand**

Before revenue, pre-seed startups have minimal quantitative metrics, and investors' core question is: 

> *"Is there **credible** evidence that this team can solve a **significant** problem?"*
> 

Since traditional revenue metrics are absent, founders must demonstrate traction through proxies such as **early usage**, **strong engagement**, and **clear signals of market demand**. Key metrics include:

- **Beta users / LoIs**: To valid problem-solution fit, investors increasingly expect founders to show early customer interest or LoIs (Letter of Intent), indicating a real, urgent need. For example, [31%](https://www.forumvc.com/research/state-of-the-vc-market-pre-seed-and-seed-2024) of pre-seed investors in a 2024 survey wanted to see clear evidence of market and product validation. Among pre-seed startups with a launched MVP or beta testers in [a 2024 study](https://www.forumvc.com/research/state-of-the-vc-market-pre-seed-and-seed-2024), 31% achieved valuations between $10M and $15M.
- **Product-Market Fit** (**PMF) score**: The classic Sean Ellis PMF ****survey asks "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?" – if **~[40%](https://newsletter.10minmba.com/p/the-single-question-that-predicts) or more** answer "Very disappointed," it would be a strong PMF signal.
- **User Engagement**: Active usage metrics (e.g. DAUs/MAUs or retention of beta users) demonstrate product stickiness. High retention or strong user feedback can substitute for revenue at this stage. Although there is no clear metric or benchmark for this phase, here is a general FYI:
    - A **DAU/MAU ratio** (daily active users as a fraction of monthly) **above ~[20%](https://mixpanel.com/blog/mau/)** is generally "good." The average for SaaS products is [13%](https://www.gainsight.com/essential-guide/product-management-metrics/dau-mau/), while B2B SaaS products often target ~[40%](https://www.gainsight.com/essential-guide/product-management-metrics/dau-mau/). The DAU/MAU ratio was originally popularized by Facebook, which achieved over 50%, showing incredible stickiness.
    - Likewise, early user retention is critical. A general guideline for *all stages*: **Day-1 retention** **above ~[30–40%](https://www.focusedchaos.co/p/9-early-metrics-that-predict-plg)** is considered good for product-led startups, and **Week-1 (D7) retention** **above ~[20–30%](https://www.focusedchaos.co/p/9-early-metrics-that-predict-plg)** is healthy.
- **Initial Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)** (if any): While many pre-seed startups are pre-revenue, any recurring revenue – even a few thousand in ARR – is a strong signal that customers are willing to pay, indicating validation of both product and business model.

**Summary of Metrics Focus**: Beta users / LoIs (>0), PMF score (> 40%), DAU/MAU ratio (>20%), Retention (>20%), ARR (>0).

> **Narrative Angle:** 
> 
> **Vision and early traction**. At Pre-seed, **qualitative storytelling often outweighs hard numbers**. Pre-seed valuations rely on **an exceptional team**, **a compelling vision** or **strong narratives**. But demonstrating tangible traction (users or ARR) can meaningfully boost valuation, and therefore savvy founders should highlight any promising metrics: e.g. 
> 
> "*Our beta has a 25% DAU/MAU stickiness and 35% Day-1 retention, indicating strong engagement*,"

### **2. Seed Stage: Proving Traction**

Due to the dual pressures of a slower fundraising market and higher investor expectations for Series A+ rounds, the average time between seed and Series A fundraising rounds is extending to [more than two years in 2024](https://www.forumvc.com/research/state-of-the-vc-market-pre-seed-and-seed-2024), up from 1.7 years in 2019. 

At Seed, it's not enough to have initial traction—investors want to see that product-market fit is driving **scalable, efficient growth**. Seed-stage startups must demonstrate that they can **grow both rapidly and efficiently**. Key metrics include:

- **ARR**: In 2025, seed startups are expected to show meaningful ARR traction. The median seed round in 2024 already saw **$0.3–0.5M** ARR as [the new standard](https://www.forumvc.com/research/state-of-the-vc-market-pre-seed-and-seed-2024), up from ~$0.2M several years ago. Those with early ARR [can justify higher valuations](https://www.forumvc.com/research/state-of-the-vc-market-pre-seed-and-seed-2024)—for example, seed companies with >$250K ARR are often valued at >$20M. This suggests that even modest recurring revenue can meaningfully improve pricing leverage in seed rounds.
- **ARR Growth**: Rapid user or revenue growth indicates product–market fit. Although the median growth rate for startups in this stage varies from 30% to 100% across different surveys, the 2024 top-quantile benchmark is generally **ARR YoY growth >2.5x** (265% by [SaaS Capital](https://www.saas-capital.com/research/private-saas-company-growth-rate-benchmarks/); 445% by [Emergence](https://www.emcap.com/thoughts/beyond-benchmarks); 250% by [Open View / High Alpha](https://www.highalpha.com/2024-saas-benchmarks-report)). Consistent double-digit monthly growth (i.e. MoM growth ≥ 10%, or YoY growth ~3×) is a strong seed‐stage signal.
- **Capital Efficiency & Runway**: Proving capital efficiency is critical in the 2025 fundraising market. Investors expect founders to be capital-efficient and plan for [**18](https://www.emcap.com/thoughts/beyond-benchmarks) to [24](https://www.forumvc.com/research/state-of-the-vc-market-pre-seed-and-seed-2024) months of runway** to allow for pivots and to achieve higher benchmarks before the next funding round, reducing fundraising pressure.

**Summary of Metrics Focus:** ARR (~$0.3–0.5M), ARR YoY growth (>2.5x), Runway (~18-24 mo).

> **Narrative Angle:** 
> 
> **"Land-and-expand" efficiently**. Seed founders should frame a story of **fast and efficient growth**. For example: 
> 
> "*We're achieving 3x growth in our first year post-launch. We've kept our burn multiple around 2×, balancing growth with a lean operation. This capital-efficient growth gives us 2+ years runway, so your Seed investment will fuel product improvements and an expanding customer base – not just patch a leaky bucket.*"

### **3. Series A: Scaling Efficiently**

Series A investors in 2025 are looking for evidence of a **scalable go-to-market** and **efficiency in growth**. Key metrics include:

- **ARR**: In 2023, most VCs expected Series A startups to achieve [>$2.5–3 M ARR](https://medium.com/point-nine-news/what-does-it-take-to-raise-capital-in-saas-in-2023-56d8f617714), up from the ~$1–2 M norm of a few years ago. In today's market, the old ~$1M ARR 'floor' no longer holds. Many investors now prefer to wait until startups reach **$3M+ ARR**, raising the entry bar for Series A capital. Truly standout Series A companies might have **~$5M ARR**.
- **ARR Growth**: Investors want to see rapid growth momentum heading into Series A. Although several years ago, 3x YoY ARR growth was expected at Series A, as many VCs cited the "T2D3" pattern (Triple, Triple, Double, …), the benchmark in 2024 declined to a median of ~$50% and top-quantile **>100%** (103% by [SaaS Capital](https://www.saas-capital.com/research/private-saas-company-growth-rate-benchmarks/); 100% by [Emergence](https://www.emcap.com/thoughts/beyond-benchmarks); 115% by [Open View / High Alpha](https://www.highalpha.com/2024-saas-benchmarks-report)).
- **Net Dollar Retention** (**NDR** or **NRR**): In 2024, NRR around 100% was common for private SaaS for this stage, indicating upsells from happy customers cover any revenue churn. While top-quartile Series A companies in surveys pushed NRR to >**110%**, the transactional data shows a top quantile NRR from [Chartmogul](https://chartmogul.com/reports/saas-retention-the-new-normal/#nrr-benchmarks-by-arr) only reaching **92%**.
- **Sales Efficiency**: Series A investors now scrutinize unit economics far more than in the 2020–21 boom. Four common metrics for sales efficiency:
    - **CAC Payback Period** measures the time to recoup customer acquisition cost. An ideal CAC payback of <**12 months** is often cited for startups. In 2024's tougher climate, most startups had paybacks extending to ~18–24 months, yet top performers still achieved <12 months (9 mo by [Emergence](https://www.emcap.com/thoughts/beyond-benchmarks); impressive median of 8 mo and top-quantile of 5 mo by [Open View / High Alpha](https://www.highalpha.com/2024-saas-benchmarks-report)).
    - **Burn Multiple** (cash burn / net ARR added) is another vital efficiency metric. At this stage, around **1–2×** is viewed as healthy. Best-in-class Series A startups even achieve ~1× (spending ~$1 to add $1 of ARR, often via product-led growth or efficient sales). By contrast, a burn multiple >2.5× would be a red flag in 2025. However, Emergence survey shows B2B Series A SaaS with median Burn Multiple of 4x and top quantile 2x in 2024.
    - **ARR/FTE** (Full-time employee) is usually used to measure productivity. The development of AI has driven this ratio up: for $1–5M ARR companies, median ARR/FTE was ~[$95K](https://www.emcap.com/thoughts/beyond-benchmarks)-[$120K](https://www.highalpha.com/2024-saas-benchmarks-report) in 2024, while top quantile Series A startups achieved **>$185K** per FTE.

**Summary of Metrics Focus:** ARR (~$3-5M), ARR YoY Growth (> 100%), NRR (>100-110%), CAC Payback (<12 months), ARR/FTE (>$120K), Burn Multiple (~1-2x).

> **Narrative Angle:** 
> 
> **Efficient growth engine**. Series A investors want to hear that the startup can **scale revenue without reckless burn**. Founders should highlight metrics that showcase **capital-efficient growth**. For example: 
> 
> "*Our NRR is 105%—customers expand usage, a testament to our product value. We've achieved this while keeping CAC payback to ~12 months and operating with high productivity – about $180K ARR per employee, which reaches top-tier for our ARR band. In short, every $1 invested in sales is translating to >$1 of ARR within a year, and our existing customers are growing their spend with us. This efficient growth engine is why we only need a modest Series A to reach the next milestones.*"

### **4. Series B/C: Proving Scalable Economics**

By Series B/C, investors' core question shifts from "*can this grow"* to "*can this scale **predictably, profitably, and become dominant** in its category?*" Companies ($5–50M+ ARR) must demonstrate both **significant scale** and **a proven business model**. Key metrics that growth-equity investors prioritize:

- **ARR & Scale**: ARR size is a gating item for later rounds. The median B2B SaaS company raising Series B in 2024 has about [$10 M](https://www.vccafe.com/2024/06/06/2023-2024-b2b-saas-benchmarks/) ARR. Top-quartile Series B companies might have on the order of **$15–20 M+** ARR. By Series C, many companies are in the **$20–40 M** ARR range. These numbers have increased from a few years ago – e.g., ~$5M ARR was enough for Series B back in 2019, but expectations are higher now as companies stay private longer and raise later. Hitting these ARR levels demonstrates substantial market adoption.
- **ARR Growth**: Although growth will naturally decelerate from the triple-digit rates of earlier stages, Series B/C companies are still expected to deliver strong growth. Yet, given the macro slowdown, 2024 median YoY ARR growth ****for $5–20M ARR SaaS companies fell to ~20–30%(from ~50% prior), though top quartile still grows ~**50–60%+**. The ability to sustain high growth on a larger revenue base is crucial for maintaining venture-level returns.
- **NRR**: By Series B/C, investors prioritize unit economics and retention, and NRR or NDR typically becomes a north-star metric. Investors view strong NRR as a sign of a product's durability and expansion potential. A median NRR ~90-100% is common in broader private SaaS benchmarks, with **110%+** being best-in-class. In fact, many growth investors now say "*NRR is the new ARR*" – emphasizing that expansion and retention signal a healthier business than raw growth.
- **Gross Margin** is scrutinized too: By the growth stage, SaaS companies are expected to demonstrate high gross margins, approaching software-company norms. ~70–80% gross margin is the typical range for Series B/C. **80%+** is a common target to ensure scalability. For example, Serena Capital advises targeting ~[80%+](https://www.vccafe.com/2024/06/06/2023-2024-b2b-saas-benchmarks/) gross margin to show scalable economics. But Open View reports that top performers could achieve [**85%+](https://www.highalpha.com/2024-saas-benchmarks-report)** at this stage.
- **Go-to-Market Efficiency**: Growth investors focus sharply on efficiency metrics to ensure the company isn't buying revenue at an unsustainable cost.
    - **CAC Payback** (fully-loaded) should ideally remain ≤18–24 months by Series B/C (shorter if targeting SMB, slightly longer tolerable for enterprise deals). In practice, 14–27 month paybacks are typical—but investors look for evidence of shortening cycles, which suggest marketing/sales repeatability. Top-quartile performers manage **~8-13 months or less**.
    - **Burn Multiple:** Growth rounds in 2024 come with an expectation of disciplined burn. A median B2B Series B/C startup might have a burn multiple ~2–3× in 2024, while top performers are in range of 1-2x, according to Emergence. In general investors view ≤2× as "good" and <1× as excellent at this stage. ([JPMorgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/business-planning/does-your-startup-have-enough-runway-to-survive)'s recent guidance: <1 is excellent, 1–1.5 great, >3 very problematic)
    - **ARR/FTE**: Productivity per employee increases dramatically at this stage, with a median of [$150-175k](https://www.highalpha.com/2024-saas-benchmarks-report), up from $95-120k at Series A companies. If efficiently run, top quantile Series B/C startups could achieve [$220-265k](https://www.emcap.com/thoughts/beyond-benchmarks) of ARR per employee.

**Summary of Metrics Focus:** ARR ($15M+ for series B; $20M+ for series C), YoY ARR growth (>50%), NRR (>110%), Gross Margin (>80%), CAC Payback (<18 months), Burn Multiple (≤2×), ARR per FTE (>$200K).

> **Narrative Angle:** 
> 
> **Prove the business model works at scale**. Unlike earlier rounds that reward speed, Series B/C investors reward **sustainable scale**—with a clear emphasis on retention, margins, and capital efficiency. The founder's story should pivot from pure growth to **quality of growth**. For example: 
> 
> "*We're now at $20M ARR growing ~50% YoY, which is top-quartile for our size. More importantly, our NRR is 110% – expansion revenue is fueling growth with little incremental CAC. Our Burn Multiple is down to ~1.3× this year, versus 2.5× a year ago, reflecting much higher capital efficiency in scaling. Gross margins are a healthy 80%. This means we're growing fast and nearing profitability, a combination that commands premium valuations. In short, we've built a scalable model: we can continue 30–40% growth without burning heaps of cash.*"

### **5. Expansion & Pre-IPO: Durable Economics**

As a company approaches an IPO, the focus is on achieving **public-company benchmarks** and proving out the business model fully. Investors (late-stage VCs, growth equity, crossover funds) prioritize metrics that indicate **durability**, **market dominance**, and **a path to profitability**:

- **ARR Scale & Growth**: Recent SaaS IPO candidates have tended to be larger (an average ARR of $690M in 2024 vs. ~$300M in 2017-2021) and slightly slower-growing (an average ARR YoY growth of 26% vs ~50% in recent 15 years) than those a few years ago. In 2024, [Meritech](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/saastr-annual-2024-the-real-data-on-what-it-takes-to-go-big-and-eventually-ipo-with-meritech-capital/272042177) suggests that a typical IPO-bound SaaS company should have **$400M+** ARR and be growing **30%+** YoY. Public investors increasingly value profitable growth over hypergrowth—especially in the current rate and risk environment. However, faster growth is still a valuation lever. The implied forward growth (guidance) also matters for IPO pricing – companies that can guide to, say, 30%+ forward growth often achieve better initial valuations.
- **Rule of 40 and Profitability** :
    - Profitability becomes a key focus in Series D+ financing. While not all IPOs are profitable, the trend is to go out with a clear path to profits. [For example](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/saastr-annual-2024-the-real-data-on-what-it-takes-to-go-big-and-eventually-ipo-with-meritech-capital/272042177), across 2018–2024 SaaS IPOs, the median LTM operating margin was –6% (near break-even) and top quartile was +8% at IPO. Especially 2023–24 saw [a clear shift](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/the-cloud-100-benchmarks-report): "the year of efficiency" where profitable growth trumped growth-at-all-costs. Many late-stage SaaS firms cut costs to flip from negative 20–30% operating margins to around **0% or positive single digits**. The best are achieving **+10% to +20% FCF margins** while still growing respectably.
    - Late-stage SaaS companies face a natural slowdown in growth as they scale, making the **Rule of 40** (growth % + profit % ≥ 40) a critical benchmark. The best late-stage companies combine strong growth with positive profitability, making **30% growth with +10% margins (net 40%)** an elite standard. In reality, few private SaaS firms met the Rule of 40 in 2024—KeyBanc's survey found none of 100+ respondents at 40% or higher. The median is currently in the **25–30s** for private firms according to [Open View survey](https://www.highalpha.com/2024-saas-benchmarks-report), but investors love to see progress toward 40.
- Retention and Customer Metrics: Public investors pay close attention to net retention, churn, and customer acquisition efficiency as indicators of future growth and profitability.
    - **NRR** at scale is still watched – A company that IPOs with NRR [**>115%**](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/saastr-annual-2024-the-real-data-on-what-it-takes-to-go-big-and-eventually-ipo-with-meritech-capital/272042177) is highly regarded (the average at IPO was [~119%](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/saastr-annual-2024-the-real-data-on-what-it-takes-to-go-big-and-eventually-ipo-with-meritech-capital/272042177) NRR during 2018-2024). High NRR companies tend to outperform because they grow primarily through existing customer expansion, reducing dependence on new logo acquisition. As a comparison, [public SaaS median](https://meritechanalytics.com/) NRR is ~110% in June 2025, so anything significantly above that signals exceptional retention economics.
    - CAC payback at IPO is expected to be efficient: the company should show that its growth machine has a reasonable cost. In private SaaS surveys, median fully-loaded CAC payback for >$50M ARR companies was **~20 months**, which is acceptable to public investors in a growth name. As a comparison, [public SaaS median](https://meritechanalytics.com/) CAC payback is ~25 months and 75% quantile is ~14 months in June 2025.

**Summary of Metrics Focus:** ARR Growth (>30%), Rule-of-40 (>30%), Operating margin (>0%), NRR (>115%), CAC Payback (< 20 mo).

> **Narrative Angle:** 
> 
> "**IPO-ready: durable growth with profitability**." At this stage, the company's story to investors should radiate confidence that it can go public successfully. Founders will emphasize metrics like, 
> 
> "*We consistently run at a Rule of 40 score ~40 now, e.g. 25% growth with 15% free cash flow margin – a balance only a handful of cloud companies achieve. We've also maintained ~80% gross margins and improved operating margin to +10%. This puts us in the top decile of SaaS companies at scale.*"
